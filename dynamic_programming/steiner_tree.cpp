// Consider an undirected graph G=(V,E)G=(V,E) with nonnegative edge costs. 
// Given a set T⊆V of k vertices called terminals. 
// A Steiner tree is a subset F⊆E of edges that contains a path between each pair of terminals. 

// For example, if T=V, then the Steiner trees are the same as the connected subgraphs. 
// It is a fact that the decision version of the Steiner tree problem is NP-complete. 

// Give a dynamic programming algorithm for this problem (i.e., for computing a Steiner tree with the fewest number of edges) 
// that has running time of the form O(c^k poly(n))
// where cc is a constant (like 4) and poly is some polynomial function.
