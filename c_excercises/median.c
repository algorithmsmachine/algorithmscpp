// median of 2 sorted arrays of diff sizes

#include <stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>


// Approach 1 : merge arrays and then 
//for odd count, median will be (m+n)/2
//for even count,  median will be average of elements at index ((m+n)/2 â€“ 1) and (m+n)/2

// Approach 2 :
// first getting medians of the two sorted arrays

// if middle element of the smaller array is less than the middle element of the larger array
//       reduce the search space to the first half of the larger array and the second half of the smaller array.

// if  the middle element of the smaller array is greater than the middle element of the larger array then 
//       reduce the search space to the first half of the smaller array and second half of the larger array.

// In each step one half of each array is discarded. So the algorithm takes O(min(log m, log n)) time to reach the median value.
