// Number of Triangles in an Undirected Graph
 
 //  compute An for an adjacency matrix representation of graph, then a value An[i][j] represents number of distinct walks between vertex i to j in graph.  
 // In A3, we get all distinct paths of length 3 between every pair of vertices which is a triangle
 // time complexity of above algorithm is O(V^3)
 // can improve the performance to O(V2.8074) using Strassenâ€™s matrix multiplication algorithm
