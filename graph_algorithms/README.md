# Grapahs 

most commonly used representations of a graph. 
1. Adjacency Matrix -  2D array be adj[][]
2. Adjacency List  - 

**Repesenting a Graph using class vs vector**

Vectors ( dynamic arrays) - Vector is template class and is C++ only construct whereas arrays are built-in language construct and present in both C and C++. 

- Vectors, unlike arrays, are resizable as they grow and shrink being allocated ono heap memory.
- Arrays have to be deallocated explicitly if defined dynamically whereas vectors are automatically de-allocated from heap memory if the varable goes out of scope. 

some of the other STL containers: 
- std::vector, 
- std::set, 
- std::list. 

**Vector pair vs Map**

- Vector are good for small scale, all the memory in a vector is always contiguous. However for large scale finidng an elemnt in map takes fewer operations.
