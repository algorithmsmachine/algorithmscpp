# Linked List 

**array vs Linkedinlist**

Arrays
- fixed size of allocated memeory and thus the upperlimit has to be known 
- insertion is array is expensive as all elements need to be shifted one place to create room . Same for deletion

On contrary Linked list 
- dynamic size and ease of inseryion/ deletion 
- but only sequential ( no dynamic) access 
- extra memeory for pointer to next element 
- not cache firendly without any contihious memeory or locality of refenrce
